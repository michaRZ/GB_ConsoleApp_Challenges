# Gold Badge Console Application Challenges

### by Michaela Raines


<br>
As I am apparently the Jack of all trades around campus at fictional mega conglomerate Komodo, I worked on developing these applications for a few of our departments:<br>
<br>

+ Komodo Cafe
+ Badges
+ Greetings
<br>
<br>
## What You'll Find

### In Komodo Cafe<br>
Use this specialty manager application to lord over your restaurants menu, with options to view all, add, update, and remove menu items.

### In Badges
Keep corporate secure with this application designed to keep campus access at your fingertips. View and add new employee authorised areas, and even take them away! That's right Toby, no more break room access for you!

### In Greetings
Keep up with literally everyone in the world a la Bruce Almighty with the Komodo Marketing Customer Database application! Whether they already pay for your service, they used to pay for your service, or they're an unsuspecting random person, if they have an email inbox -- you're in it!

## In Summary
All silliness aside, this capstone project for the Gold Badge phase at Eleven Fifty Academy has been a slightly frustrating, greatly rewarding experience. I felt it was the right balance between challenging and fun, and I found myself in a flow state for hours at a time. Building out these console applications strengthened what I already knew and gave me clear indications of the skills I need to continue to develop. I am very much looking forward to the next phase!
